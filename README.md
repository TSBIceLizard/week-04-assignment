# Assignment Reflections

## Tips from Manny:

- The bigger picture is scary and overwhelming! Partition the project into smaller digestable stages/chunks/parts! (Use the user stories to help you).

- Deploy to render as soon as possible! This way you won't have to repurpose everything for render.com from localhost!

- Plan! plan plan! --> A plan keeps you focused
